*** synch_delay is how many updates the game loop spends on each frame in the villain's animation
*** speed is scaled by a factor of 100
*** attack_radius must be smaller than aware_radius for enemy user-detection to work accurately.
*** attack trigger is what frame of the attack animation the game determines if the villain has struck the hero
*** attack length is how long of an interval the villain has to strike, measured in frames, starting at attack_trigger
