	else: identity established in world generation file.

Choice
___________
Note: The interaction command will change the plot phase of the GameWorld. Be careful!
The current plot phase is used to look up dialogue choices for the current interaction output. 
The message found in the current plot phase dialogue is then associated with a plot phase 
transition. If the user selects this choice, it will change the plot phase to this 
phase. This will not affect the cutscene's dialogue until after the cutscene has concluded.

!!Note: The last two arguments occur in pairs. There can be an arbitary amount, but they 
must always be in pairs! In other words, if there is only 2 choices, there should be two
pairs of arguments after the control code.

i 99 3 73 4

If there are 3 choices, there should be three pairs of arguments after the control code.

i 100 2 103 3

This signifies the number of choices presented to the user: the message index of the 
displayed choice, and the GameWorld plot phase this selection will trigger (after
the cutscene has concluded!)
___________
i [*] [*]
    1: Message Index
	Note: Index of message in /words/dialogue_plot_phase
    2: Plot Phase association
